# Aristotle

A (fairly) simple program to implement some concepts I've been learning in my Logic 101 class.

Concepts implemented/planned include:
- Truth tables
- The square of oppositions
- Determine the converse, obverse, and contrapositive of a given categorical claim
- Truth-functional Logic

All of the logic in this program will be based strictly on what I have learned in class, so anything that differs from the lessons will not be included.
